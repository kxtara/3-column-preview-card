## Overview

This was a great challenge that I really enjoyed completing.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

When I saw the challenge, I knew that I was going to use Flexbox. I structured my HTML with three different sections for the three columns, then I added the images and text. Next, I moved on to the styling, where I decided to use "rem" instead of "pixels".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned to use relative units instead of absolute units.

### Continued development

Moving forward I want to work more with active states, Grid, and transitions.
